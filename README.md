# Obsidian superscript

This is a fork from [Benature's obsidian-underline plugin](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-underline).

Simiarly, use the hotkey `cmd/ctrl+S` to add an superscript format to the selected text, which will render `<sup>content</sup>` (or `<sup></sup>` when no selection). Additionally, the plugin will also undo the superscript when superscript text is selected.
